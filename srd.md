# Software Requirement Documentation SRD: Goal-Oriented BDI Multi-Agent Business Operation System (MABOS)

Building a Goal-Oriented BDI Multi-Agent Business Operation System (MABOS) by extending the Dify open source project. I have thoroughly analyzed the conversation and will now organize it into a comprehensive software requirement documentation that a full stack developer proficient in Python and JavaScript can use to extend the Dify codebase and incorporate the MABOS functionality.

Software Requirement Documentation: Goal-Oriented BDI Multi-Agent Business Operation System (MABOS)

1. Introduction
   1.1 Purpose
   The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for extending the Dify open source project to incorporate a Goal-Oriented BDI Multi-Agent Business Operation System (MABOS). The MABOS will leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and ontologies to enable intelligent reasoning, decision-making, and knowledge management capabilities for optimizing business development, operations, and growth processes.


   1.2 Scope
   The scope of this project includes the development of the MABOS as an extension to the existing Dify codebase. The MABOS will integrate with the CrewAI framework and utilize libraries such as [[Owlready2]] for ontology management and [[NetworkX]] for knowledge graph representation and manipulation.


2. System Overview
   2.1 Architecture
   The MABOS will follow a Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture based on the goal-oriented belief, desire, and intention multi-agent business operating system platform. It will integrate LLMs for natural language understanding and generation, and leverage ontology-driven knowledge representation and management using Owlready2 and OWL ontologies. The system will be designed with modular components for reasoning, decision-making, process automation, and user interaction.

The identified classes and API routes provide a solid foundation for implementing the core functionalities of MABOS, such as ontology management, knowledge graph construction, reasoning and inference, integration with CrewAI, and user interaction.

However, it's important to note that the actual implementation may require further refinement and adaptation based on the specific requirements, architecture, and constraints of the Dify project. Close collaboration with the Dify development team and stakeholders will be crucial to ensure a smooth and successful integration of MABOS.

Prioritizes alignment with the Dify tech stack, reducing the learning curve for developers and ensuring maintainability. However, it may limit the flexibility in choosing the most suitable technologies for MABOS.

    - Align the programming languages and frameworks used for MABOS with the existing Dify tech stack. If Dify uses Python and JavaScript, choose compatible frameworks like Flask or FastAPI for the backend and React or Angular for the frontend.
    - Define clear integration points between MABOS and Dify components using RESTful APIs or message queues. Specify the data exchange formats, such as JSON for structured data and RDF for ontologies and knowledge graphs.
    - Use a combination of relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing structured data and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) for storing unstructured data related to MABOS. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of different types of data.
    - Implement proper data access and manipulation methods within the MABOS classes to interact with the databases and ensure data consistency and integrity.
    - Establish clear communication channels and protocols between MABOS and Dify components to facilitate seamless integration and data exchange.
    - Develop comprehensive documentation and guidelines for integrating MABOS into the Dify codebase, including code examples, best practices, and troubleshooting tips.
    - Conduct thorough testing and validation of the MABOS integration to ensure compatibility, performance, and reliability within the Dify ecosystem.
