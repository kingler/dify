Sure! Hereâ€™s a detailed PlantUML code for a state machine diagram representing the different states and transitions of an agent in a multi-agent system:

```plantuml
@startuml
[*] --> Idle

state Idle {
  [*] --> WaitingForTask
  WaitingForTask : Entry / Await task assignment
  WaitingForTask --> Assigned : Task assigned
}

state Assigned {
  [*] --> Planning
  Planning : Entry / Develop plan to accomplish task

  Planning --> Executing : Plan developed
  Executing : Entry / Execute the plan

  Executing --> Verifying : Task execution complete
  Verifying : Entry / Verify task completion

  Verifying --> Completed : Task verified
  Verifying --> Failed : Task failed
}

state Completed {
  [*] --> Reporting
  Reporting : Entry / Report task completion
  Reporting --> Idle : Report sent
}

state Failed {
  [*] --> ErrorHandling
  ErrorHandling : Entry / Handle task failure
  ErrorHandling --> Idle : Error handled
}

Idle --> Assigned : New task received
Completed --> Idle : Task completion acknowledged
Failed --> Idle : Error resolution acknowledged
