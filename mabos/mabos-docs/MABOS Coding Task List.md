## Project consists of three main components:

1. API: Likely responsible for handling backend logic and data management.
2. MABOS: The core multi-agent business operating system, which includes various agents, communication, knowledge management, and other related modules.
3. Web: The frontend web application, built using Next.js, that will serve as the user interface for managing the instantiated multi-agent system.

## Task List
The goal is to ensure that the MABOS feature is seamlessly integrated into the web application, leveraging the API for communication between the frontend and the multi-agent system.

- [ ] **API Interface:** [[ Define a clear interface or communication mechanism between the MABOS component and the API]]

- [ ] **Ontology management:** [[Implement a more structured approach to ontology management in the knowledge management module, possibly using a standard ontology language like OWL (Web Ontology Language)]]

- [ ] **Planning:** [[Expand the planning module to support more sophisticated planning techniques, such as hierarchical task network (HTN) planning or partial-order planning (POP)]]

- [ ] **Web app integration:** [[Implement a clear way for the web application to communicate with the API, possibly through a dedicated service or API client module]]

- [ ] **State between the UI and the multi-agent system:** [[Integrate a state management solution, such as Redux, MobX, or XState to handle the complex state interactions between the UI and the multi-agent system]]

- [ ] **Organize UI components:** [[Organize the UI components related to the MABOS feature in a way that reflects the structure of the multi-agent system, making it easier to manage and maintain]]

- [ ] **Establish well-defined API endpoints for the web application:** [[Establish well-defined API endpoints for the web application to interact with, using standard protocols like REST or GraphQL]]

- [ ] **Define a data format that is easily serializable and parsable:** [[mabos/mabos-docs/Define a data format that is easily serializable and parsable, such as JSON or Protocol Buffers, for data exchange between the web application, API, and MABOS]]

- [ ] **Implement a clear interface for the MABOS component to receive requests and send responses:** [[Implement a clear interface for the MABOS component to receive requests and send responses, possibly through a message queue or pub sub system]]

- [ ] **Create a comprehensive set of test cases:** [[Create a comprehensive set of test cases that cover various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling]]

- [ ] **Perform end-to-end testing:** [[Perform end-to-end testing, starting from the web application UI, going through the API, and finally to the MABOS component]]

- [ ] **Monitor the system performance:** [[Monitor the system performance and resource utilization under different load conditions to identify any bottlenecks or scalability issues]]

- [ ] **Create detailed documentation for each component:** [[Create detailed documentation for each component, including the web application, API, and MABOS, describing their purpose, structure, and usage]]

- [ ] **Establish a clear process for updating and maintaining the system:** [[Establish a clear process for updating and maintaining the system, including regular code reviews, testing, and deployment]]
