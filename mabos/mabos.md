`on storage system and provides` methods for retrieving configurations (`get_configuration`), updating configurations (`update_configuration`), and validating configuration data (`validate_configuration`) for specific components.

22. Internationalization and Localization:
```python
# mabos/localization/localization_manager.py
class LocalizationManager:
    def __init__(self, translations):
        self.translations = translations
        # Initialize other attributes and components

    def get_translation(self, key, language):
        # Retrieve the translation for a specific key in a given language
        pass

    def set_user_language(self, user, language):
        # Set the preferred language for a user
        pass

    def format_date(self, date, language):
        # Format a date according to the specified language
        pass

    def format_number(self, number, language):
        # Format a number according to the specified language
        pass
```


The `LocalizationManager` class adds support for multiple languages and locales to cater to a global user base. It manages translations, date and number formatting, and user language preferences. The manager provides methods for retrieving translations (`get_translation`), setting user language preferences (`set_user_language`), formatting dates (`format_date`), and formatting numbers (`format_number`) based on the specified language.

These code snippets provide a starting point for implementing the additional agents, functions, and managers in the Goal-Oriented BDI Multi-Agent Business Operating System. Each component is designed to handle specific responsibilities and collaborate with other components to achieve the overall system goals.

When implementing these components, consider the following best practices:

1. Adhere to the SOLID principles to ensure a modular, extensible, and maintainable codebase.
2. Use appropriate design patterns, such as the Repository pattern for data access and the Factory pattern for object creation, to promote code reusability and flexibility.
3. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting.
4. Follow secure coding practices to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
5. Write unit tests for each component to ensure their correctness and maintain a high level of code quality.
6. Document the purpose, inputs, outputs, and dependencies of each component to facilitate understanding and collaboration among team members.

Remember to integrate these components seamlessly with the existing agents and functions in the system. Regularly review and refactor the codebase to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and maintainability.

By incorporating these additional agents, functions, and managers, the Goal-Oriented BDI Multi-Agent Business Operating System will have enhanced capabilities in data management, security, reporting, user management, process optimization, monitoring, and localization. This will result in a more comprehensive and robust system that can effectively support the Dify Agent development platform.
