# Plan

In this revised version of the plan.py class, I've incorporated several aspects from the research paper:

- Distributed Planning: The execute method now takes a list of agents as input, allowing for distributed execution of actions by multiple agents. The select_agent method is introduced to choose the most suitable agent for each action based on agent capabilities and other criteria
- Hierarchical Planning: The decompose method is added to support hierarchical planning by decomposing a high-level plan into more detailed sub-plans. The create_sub_plan method is a placeholder for defining sub-actions and their dependencies for each action in the plan.
Plan Merging: The merge method is introduced to combine the current plan with another plan. It merges the actions, resolves conflicts, and optimizes the merged plan. The resulting merged plan has updated attributes such as plan ID, priority, preconditions, postconditions, and constraints.
- Plan Repair and Adaptation: The repair method is added to handle plan failures by replacing a failed action with an alternative action. The find_alternative_action method is a placeholder for finding a suitable alternative action based on preconditions, effects, and constraints.
- Plan Execution and Monitoring: The execute method now involves monitoring the progress of action execution and handling failures. It selects the appropriate agent for each action and tracks the status of the plan. The evaluate method is a placeholder for evaluating the success or effectiveness of the plan based on the actual outcomes and postconditions.
- 
The plan.py class incorporate key aspects from the research paper, such as distributed planning, hierarchical planning, plan merging, plan repair and adaptation, and plan execution and monitoring. The specific implementation details of methods like select_agent, find_alternative_action, and create_sub_plan would need to be tailored to your particular multi-agent system and planning requirements.

Please note that this revised version provides a high-level structure and placeholders for certain methods. Further refinement and implementation of these methods would be necessary based on the specific algorithms, heuristics, and domain knowledge relevant to your planning system.
