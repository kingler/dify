Building a Goal-Oriented BDI Multi-Agent Business Operation System (MABOS) by extending the DifyAI open source project. 

Software Requirement Documentation: Goal-Oriented BDI Multi-Agent Business Operation System (MABOS)- This a High-level overview of the requirements and considerations for extending the Dify codebase with MABOS functionality. 

1. Introduction 
	1. Purpose The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for extending the Dify open source project to incorporate a Goal-Oriented BDI Multi-Agent Business Operation System (MABOS). The MABOS will leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and ontologies to enable intelligent reasoning, decision-making, and knowledge management capabilities for optimizing business development, operations, and growth processes. 
	2. Scope The scope of this project includes the development of the MABOS as an extension to the existing Dify codebase. The MABOS will utilize libraries such as Owlready2 for ontology management and NetworkX for knowledge graph representation and manipulation.
2. System Overview 
	1. Architecture The MABOS will follow a Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture based on the goal-oriented belief, desire, and intention multi-agent business operating system platform. It will integrate LLMs for natural language understanding and generation, and leverage ontology-driven knowledge representation and management using Owlready2 and OWL ontologies. The system will be designed with modular components for reasoning, decision-making, process automation, and user interaction. 
	2. Key Components
	    - **Ontology Management:** The system will utilize Owlready2 for loading and managing OWL ontologies, including the FIBO (Financial Industry Business Ontology) and custom-developed ontologies for business domain knowledge representation.
	    - **Knowledge Graph:** NetworkX will be used to represent and manipulate the knowledge graph, which will be constructed from the loaded ontologies. The knowledge graph will capture entities, relationships, and constraints relevant to the business domain.
	    - **Reasoning and Inference:** The system will implement various reasoning and inference capabilities, including goal-based reasoning, strategic decision-making, operational optimization, performance monitoring, risk assessment, collaboration and coordination, and adaptability and learning. These capabilities will be based on the ontological knowledge and will guide the decision-making processes of the agents.
	    - **Integration with Dify:** The MABOS will seamlessly integrate with the Dify framework, leveraging its existing architecture, communication protocols, and task execution capabilities. The integration will involve defining interfaces, data flow, and extending or modifying the Dify framework as needed.
