The knowledge management module's ontology management approach is structured and maintainable, fostering the separation of concerns, modularity, and extensibility. It enables the ontology management module to effectively support reasoning and core modules while remaining adaptable to future demands.

- [ ] Step 1: Identify the key components and responsibilities of ontology management.
      - [ ] Ontology definition and representation
      - [ ] Ontology loading and persistence
      - [ ] Ontology querying and reasoning
      - [ ] Ontology visualization
      - [ ] Integration with other modules (e.g., reasoning, core)

- [ ] Step 2: Refactor the Ontology class to align with these responsibilities.
      - [ ] Separate the concerns of ontology definition, loading, querying, and visualization.
      - [ ] Use dependency injection to decouple the Ontology class from specific implementations.
      - [ ] Define clear interfaces for ontology-related operations.

- [ ] Step 3: Implement ontology definition and representation.
      - [ ] Create separate classes for defining ontology elements (e.g., Concept, Relationship, Axiom).
      - [ ] Use a declarative approach to define ontologies using these classes.
      - [ ] Validate ontology definitions against a schema or metamodel.
      
- [ ] Step 4: Implement ontology loading and persistence.
      - [ ] Create an OntologyLoader class responsible for loading ontologies from various sources (e.g., files, databases).
      - [ ] Implement methods for saving and updating ontologies.
      - [ ] Use a pluggable architecture to support different ontology formats (e.g., OWL, RDF).
    
- [ ] Step 5: Implement ontology querying and reasoning.
      - [ ] Create an OntologyQueryEngine class responsible for executing queries on the ontology.
      - [ ] Implement methods for common query patterns (e.g., class hierarchy, property assertions).
      - [ ] Integrate with a reasoning engine (e.g., owlrl) for advanced reasoning tasks.

- [ ] Step 6: Implement ontology visualization.
      - [ ] Create an OntologyVisualizer class responsible for generating visual representations of ontologies.
      - [ ] Implement methods for different visualization formats (e.g., graphs, trees).
      - [ ] Use a pluggable architecture to support different visualization libraries.

- [ ] Step 7: Integrate ontology management with other modules.
      - [ ] Define clear interfaces for accessing ontology-related functionality from other modules (e.g., reasoning, core).
      - [ ] Use dependency injection to provide ontology instances to other modules.
      - [ ] Ensure consistent usage of ontology concepts and relationships across the system.

- [ ] Step 8: Refactor the existing code to align with the new ontology management approach.
      - [ ] Update the Ontology class in ontology.py to reflect the new structure and responsibilities.
      - [ ] Refactor the reasoning module to use the new ontology management interfaces.
      - [ ] Update the core module to integrate with the refactored ontology management module.

- [ ] Step 9: Test and validate the refactored ontology management module.
      - [ ] Create unit tests for each component of the ontology management module.
      - [ ] Ensure proper integration with other modules through integration tests.
      - [ ] Validate the performance and scalability of ontology-related operations.

- [ ] Step 10: Document and maintain the ontology management module.
      - [ ] Provide clear documentation for the ontology management module, including usage examples and best practices.
      - [ ] Establish a process for updating and evolving the ontology management module as requirements change.
      - [ ] Regularly review and refactor the ontology management module to ensure maintainability and alignment with the overall system architecture.
