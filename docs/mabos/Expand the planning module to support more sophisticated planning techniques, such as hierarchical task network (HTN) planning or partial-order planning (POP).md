Step 1: Understand the key concepts and differences between HTN planning and POP.
- HTN planning:
  - Decomposes high-level tasks into lower-level subtasks
  - Uses domain-specific knowledge to guide the decomposition process
  - Focuses on task decomposition and task ordering
- POP:
  - Represents plans as partially ordered sets of actions
  - Allows for flexible action ordering and parallelism
  - Uses causal links to maintain consistency and resolve conflicts

Step 2: Define the necessary data structures and classes for HTN planning.
- Introduce a [Task](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/api/models/mabos/planning.py#41%2C7-41%2C7) class to represent high-level tasks in HTN planning.
- Extend the [Action](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/api/models/mabos/reasoning.py#35%2C29-35%2C29) class to include methods for task decomposition.
- Create a `Method` class to encapsulate the knowledge for decomposing tasks into subtasks.
- Update the [Plan](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/api/models/mabos/reasoning.py#30%2C7-30%2C7) class to support hierarchical structure and task decomposition.

Step 3: Implement the HTN planning algorithm.
- Modify the [generate_plan](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/mabos/planning/plan.py#232%2C25-232%2C25) method in the [Plan](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/api/models/mabos/reasoning.py#30%2C7-30%2C7) class to incorporate HTN planning.
- Recursively decompose high-level tasks into lower-level subtasks using the defined methods.
- Use domain-specific knowledge to guide the decomposition process and ensure the generated plan is valid.
- Handle task interactions and constraints during the planning process.

Step 4: Extend the planning module to support POP.
- Introduce a `PartialOrderPlan` class to represent plans as partially ordered sets of actions.
- Implement methods for adding actions, causal links, and ordering constraints to the partial-order plan.
- Develop algorithms for detecting and resolving conflicts in the partial-order plan.
- Modify the [execute](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/mabos/planning/plan.py#18%2C9-18%2C9) method in the [Plan](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/api/models/mabos/reasoning.py#30%2C7-30%2C7) class to handle the execution of partial-order plans.

Step 5: Integrate HTN planning and POP with the existing planning module.
- Update the [Plan](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/api/models/mabos/reasoning.py#30%2C7-30%2C7) class to support both HTN planning and POP.
- Provide options to choose between different planning techniques based on the problem requirements.
- Ensure seamless integration with the existing planning infrastructure, including action execution and monitoring.

Step 6: Enhance the domain knowledge representation for HTN planning.
- Extend the [knowledge_management](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/mabos/mabos-docs/tree_structure.md#66%2C5-66%2C5) module to support the representation of HTN domain knowledge.
- Define a structured format for specifying task decomposition methods and constraints.
- Develop methods for parsing and reasoning over the domain knowledge to support efficient HTN planning.

Step 7: Implement plan repair and replanning mechanisms.
- Extend the [repair](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/mabos/planning/plan.py#26%2C26-26%2C26) method in the [Plan](file:///Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/Apps/sandbox/dify/api/models/mabos/reasoning.py#30%2C7-30%2C7) class to handle plan failures in the context of HTN planning and POP.
- Develop techniques for identifying the affected parts of the plan and generating alternative solutions.
- Incorporate domain-specific knowledge and heuristics to guide the plan repair process.

Step 8: Optimize the planning algorithms for performance and scalability.
- Analyze the computational complexity of the HTN planning and POP algorithms.
- Identify potential bottlenecks and optimize critical sections of the code.
- Implement heuristics and pruning techniques to reduce the search space and improve planning efficiency.

Step 9: Conduct thorough testing and evaluation.
- Develop comprehensive test cases to cover various planning scenarios and edge cases.
- Evaluate the correctness, efficiency, and scalability of the implemented planning techniques.
- Perform comparative analysis with existing planning approaches to assess the benefits and limitations of HTN planning and POP.

Step 10: Document and maintain the expanded planning module.
- Provide clear documentation for the HTN planning and POP implementations, including usage guidelines and examples.
- Establish a maintenance plan to keep the planning module updated with the latest research and improvements in the field.
- Continuously gather feedback from users and incorporate their suggestions for enhancing the planning capabilities.
